  - He knows that we don't have a choice. He knows this because he's the one that
    told us, over and over again. CHRIST, just look around and you'll know.
  - But it's all we've ever known. The whale gives us food, gives us shelter, pretends
    to be our friend and tells us this is just how it is. So we strap on our boots
    and tell ourselves that we like it. Actually??? He's doing us a favor. How caring
    is this would-be god of ours?
  - Maybe you tell yourself that it'll be over one day. You'll wake up on your farm
    with three cats and a cow named Daisy and you'll never have to worry about looking
    up and realizing you're still in this FUCKING whale. Because otherwise...
  - WHAT'S THE FUCKING POINT?!
  - WHY HAVE WE BEEN KEEPING THIS THING ALIVE???
  - The whale doesn't fuckng care. There's no shortage of us to keep it alive. It
    could give a shit about how the sausage is made as long as it can swim free in
    that BIG ASS FUCKING OCEAN of HIS! One of us slows down, throw them under! Trample
    them into the mud!
